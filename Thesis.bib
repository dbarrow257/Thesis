Recently the RENO experiment has updated its latest value on sin 2 2 θ 13 and provided new results on 5 MeV excess, Δm 2 ee , θ 13 with n-H analysis, absolute antineutrino flux measurement, and sterile neutrino search. It gives rich programs of neutrino properties, detector development, nuclear monitoring and application. Using reactor neutrinos, the future RENO-50 experiment will search for more precise measurement of θ 12 , Δ m 2 12 and mass hierarchy.}

	abstract={The next generation of very-short-baseline reactor experiments will require compact detectors operating at surface level and close to a nuclear reactor. This paper presents a new detector concept based on a composite solid scintillator technology. The detector target uses cubes of polyvinyltoluene interleaved with 6 LiF:ZnS(Ag) phosphor screens to detect the products of the inverse beta decay reaction. A multi-tonne detector system built from these individual cells can provide precise localisation of scintillation signals, making efficient use of the detector volume. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a neutron capture efficiency of over 70 % is achievable with a sufficient number of 6 LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens per cube and that an appropriate segmentation enables a measurement of the positron energy which is not limited by γ-ray leakage. First measurements of a single cell indicate that a very good neutron-gamma discrimination and high neutron detection efficiency can be obtained with adequate triggering techniques. The light yield from positron signals has been measured, showing that an energy resolution of 14%/√ E (MeV) is achievable with high uniformity. A preliminary neutrino signal analysis has been developed, using selection criteria for pulse shape, energy, time structure and energy spatial distribution and showing that an antineutrino efficiency of 40% can be achieved. It also shows that the fine segmentation of the detector can be used to significantly decrease both correlated and accidental backgrounds.}

	abstract={The T2K experiment studies oscillations of an off-axis muon neutrino beam between the J-PARC accelerator complex and the Super-Kamiokande detector. Special emphasis is placed on measuring the mixing angle θ 13 by observing ν e appearance via the sub-dominant ν μ → ν e oscillation and searching for CP violation in the lepton sector. The experiment includes a sophisticated, off-axis, near detector, the ND280, situated 280 m downstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure the properties of the neutrino beam and to understand better neutrino interactions at the energy scale below a few GeV. The data collected with the ND280 are used to study charged- and neutral-current neutrino interaction rates and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce uncertainties in the oscillation measurements by the far detector. A key element of the near detector is the ND280 electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), consisting of active scintillator bars sandwiched between lead sheets and read out with multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs). The ECal is vital to the reconstruction of neutral particles, and the identification of charged particle species. The ECal surrounds the Pi-0 detector (PØD) and the tracking region of the ND280, and is enclosed in the former UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet. This paper describes the design, construction and assembly of the ECal, as well as the materials from which it is composed. The electronic and data acquisition (DAQ) systems are discussed, and performance of the ECal modules, as deduced from measurements with particle beams, cosmic rays, the calibration system, and T2K data, is described.}

The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37 Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37 Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37 Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.}

	abstract={The Borexino experiment is running at the Laboratori del Gran Sasso in Italy since 2007. Its technical distinctive feature is the unprecedented ultralow background of the inner scintillating core, which is the basis of the outstanding achievements accumulated by the experiment. In this talk, after recalling the main features of the detector, the impressive solar data gathered so far by the experiment will be summarized, with special emphasis to the most recent and prominent result concerning the detection of the fundamental pp solar neutrino flux, which is the direct probe of the engine mechanism powering our star. Such a milestone measurement puts Borexino in the unique situation of being the only experiment able to do solar neutrino spectroscopy over the entire solar spectrum; the counterpart of this peculiar status in the oscillation interpretation of the data is the capability of Borexino alone to perform the full validation across the solar energy range of the MSW-LMA paradigm. The talk will be concluded highlighting the perspectives for the final stage of the solar program of the experiment, centered on the goal to fully complete the solar spectroscopy with the missing piece of the CNO neutrinos. If successful, such a measurement would represent the final crowning of the long quest of Borexino to unravel all the properties of the neutrinos from the Sun.}

The search was performed with the ICARUS T600 detector located at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, receiving CNGS neutrinos from CERN at an average energy of about 20 GeV, after a flight path of ∼730 km. The LSND anomaly would manifest as an excess of $\nu$                                  e                 events, characterized by a fast energy oscillation averaging approximately to                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}sin^{\{}2{\}}(1.27{\backslash}Delta m^{\{}2{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}new{\}}{\}}L/E{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu{\}}){\backslash}approx 1/2{\$}                 with probability                                                                           {\$}P{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu{\}}{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\}} = 1/2 {\backslash}sin^{\{}2{\}}(2{\backslash}theta{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}new{\}}{\}}){\$}                . The present analysis is based on 1091 neutrino events, which are about 50 {\%} of the ICARUS data collected in 2010--2011. Two clear $\nu$                                  e                 events have been found, compared with the expectation of 3.7{\textpm}0.6 events from conventional sources. Within the range of our observations, this result is compatible with the absence of a LSND anomaly. At 90 {\%} and 99 {\%} confidence levels the limits of 3.4 and 7.3 events corresponding to oscillation probabilities                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}langle P{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu{\}}{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\backslash}rangle {\backslash}le 5.4 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-3{\}}{\$}                 and                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}langle P{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu{\}}{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}nu{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\}}{\backslash}rangle {\backslash}le 1.1 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-2{\}} {\$}                 are set respectively.

	abstract={The OPERA neutrino oscillation experiment has been designed to prove the appearance of ν τ in a nearly pure ν μ beam (CNGS) produced at CERN and detected in the underground Hall C of the Gran Sasso Laboratory, 730 km away from the source. In OPERA, τ leptons resulting from the interaction of ν τ are produced in target units called bricks made of nuclear emulsion films interleaved with lead plates. The OPERA target contains 150000 of such bricks, for a total mass of 1.25 kton, arranged into walls interleaved with plastic scintillator strips. The detector is split into two identical supermodules, each supermodule containing a target section followed by a magnetic spectrometer for momentum and charge measurement of penetrating particles. Real time information from the scintillators and the spectrometers provide the identification of the bricks where the neutrino interactions occurred. The candidate bricks are extracted from the walls and, after X-ray marking and an exposure to cosmic rays for alignment, their emulsion films are developed and sent to the emulsion scanning laboratories to perform the accurate scan of the event. In this paper, we review the design and construction of the detector and of its related infrastructures, and report on some technical performances of the various components. The construction of the detector started in 2003 and it was completed in Summer 2008. The experiment is presently in the data taking phase. The whole sequence of operations has proven to be successful, from triggering to brick selection, development, scanning and event analysis.}

	abstract="The ∼ 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the predicted and observed reactor anti-neutrino flux, known as the reactor anti-neutrino anomaly, continues to intrigue. The recent discovery of an unexpected bump in the reactor anti-neutrino spectrum, as well as indications that the flux deficit is different for different fission isotopes seems to disfavour the explanation of the anomaly in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations. We critically review this conclusion in view of all available data on electron (anti)neutrino disappearance. We find that the sterile neutrino hypothesis cannot be rejected based on global data and is only mildly disfavored compared to an individual rescaling of neutrino fluxes from different fission isotopes. The main reason for this is the presence of spectral features in recent data from the NEOS and DANSS experiments. If state-of-the-art predictions for reactor fluxes are taken at face value, sterile neutrino oscillations allow a consistent description of global data with a significance close to 3$\sigma$ relative to the no-oscillation case. Even if reactor fluxes and spectra are left free in the fit, a 2$\sigma$ hint in favour of sterile neutrinos remains, with allowed parameter regions consistent with an explanation of the anomaly in terms of oscillations.",

	abstract={Neutrino oscillation was discovered through the study of atmospheric neutrinos. Atmospheric neutrinos are produced as decay products in hadronic showers resulting from collisions of cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere. Electron neutrinos and muon neutrinos are produced mainly by the decay chain of charged pions to muons and electrons. Depending on the energy of the neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos are observed as fully contained events, partially contained events and upward-going muon events. The energy range covered by these events is from a few hundred MeV to >1 TeV. Data from various experiments showed zenith angle- and energy-dependent deficit of ν μ events, while ν e events did not show any such effect. It was also shown that the ν μ survival probability obeys the sinusoidal function as predicted by neutrino oscillations. Two-flavour ν μ ↔ ν τ oscillations, with sin 2 2θ > 0.90 and Δ m 2 in the region of 1.9 × 10 −3 to 3.0 × 10 −3 eV 2 , explain all these data. Various detailed studies using high statistics atmospheric neutrino data excluded the alternative hypotheses that were proposed to explain the ν μ deficit.}

	abstract={The MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect is the adiabatic or partially adiabatic neutrino flavor conversion in media with varying density. The main notions related to the effect, its dynamics and physical picture are reviewed. The large mixing MSW effect is realized inside the Sun providing a solution of the solar neutrino problem. The small mixing MSW effect driven by the 1–3 mixing can be realized for the supernova (SN) neutrinos. Inside collapsing stars new elements of the MSW dynamics may show up: non-oscillatory transition, non-adiabatic conversion, time dependent adiabaticity violation induced by shock waves. Effects of the resonance enhancement and the parametric enhancement of oscillations can be realized for atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos in the Earth. Precise results for neutrino oscillations in low density media with arbitrary density profile are presented and the attenuation effect is described. The area of applications is the solar and SN neutrinos inside the Earth, and the results are crucial for the neutrino oscillation tomography.}

I emphasize descriptions of semi-inclusive reactions and full descriptions of the final state; the latter are needed to reconstruct the incoming neutrino energy from final-state observations. I then discuss Monte Carlo generator and more advanced transport-theoretical approaches in connection with experimental results on various reaction mechanisms. Finally, I describe the effects of uncertainties in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy on oscillation parameters. The review argues that the precision era of neutrino physics also needs precision-era generators. }

	abstract={New and more precise measurements of neutrino cross sections have renewed interest in a better understanding of electroweak interactions on nucleons and nuclei. This effort is crucial to achieving the precision goals of the neutrino oscillation program, making new discoveries, like the CP violation in the leptonic sector, possible. We review the recent progress in the physics of neutrino cross sections, putting emphasis on the open questions that arise in the comparison with new experimental data. Following an overview of recent neutrino experiments and future plans, we present some details about the theoretical development in the description of (anti)neutrino-induced quasielastic (QE) scattering and the role of multi-nucleon QE-like mechanisms. We cover not only pion production in nucleons and nuclei but also other inelastic channels including strangeness production and photon emission. Coherent reaction channels on nuclear targets are also discussed. Finally, we briefly describe some of the Monte Carlo event generators, which are at the core of all neutrino oscillation and cross-section measurements.}

	abstract="Motivated by recent studies of inclusive neutrino nucleus processes and muon capture within a correlated local Fermi gas model (LFG), we discuss the relevance of nuclear finite-size effects in these reactions at low energy, in particular for muon capture. To disentangle these effects from others coming from the reaction dynamics we employ here a simple uncorrelated shell model that embodies the typical finite-size content of the problem. The integrated decay widths of muon atoms calculated with this shell model are then compared for several nuclei with those obtained within the uncorrelated LFG, using in both models exactly the same theoretical ingredients and parameters. We find that the two predictions are in quite good agreement, within 1-7{\%}, when the shell model density and the correct energy balance is used as input in the LFG calculation. The present study indicates that, despite the low excitation energies involved in the reaction, integrated inclusive observables, like the total muon capture width, are quite independent of the fine details of the nuclear wave functions.",

It is shown that within theoretical uncertainties our previous (1994) dynamical/radiative parton distributions are compatible with most recent data and still applicable within the restricted accuracy margins of the presently available next-to-leading order calculations. Due to recent high precision measurements we also present an updated, more accurate, version of our (valence-like) dynamical input distributions. Furthermore, our perturbatively stable parameter-free dynamical predictions are extended to the extremely small-x region,                   {\$}10^{\{}-8{\}} {\backslash}lesssim x {\backslash}lesssim 10^{\{}-5{\}}{\$}                , relevant to questions concerning ultra-high-energy cosmic ray and neutrino astronomy.",

@ARTICLE{Ellis1927-qf,
  title     = "The average energy of disintegration of radium {E}",
  author    = "Ellis, C. D. and Wooster, W. A.",
  abstract  = "The problem of the velocity of the particles emitted from the
               nuclei of dis integrating radioactive atoms has always attracted
               considerable attention. It was early established that in the
               case of the $\alpha$-rays all the particles from one substance
               were emitted with the same velocity, and the latest experiments
               of Briggs have emphasised the high degree of homogeneity
               attained. This result, showing that each disintegration involves
               exactly the same emission of energy, is easily reconcilable with
               our general ideas of the radioactive processes, and, as is well
               known, there is undoubtedly some connection between this
               characteristic energy and the mean life of the body. The
               behaviour of the $\beta$-ray bodies is in sharp contrast to
               this. In place of the $\alpha$-particles all emitted with the
               same energy, we find that the disintegration electrons coming
               from the nucleus have energies distributed over a wide range.
               For example, in the case of radium E this continuous energy
               spectrum formed by the disintegration electrons has an upper
               limit at 1,050,000 volts, rises to a maximum at 300,000 volts,
               and continues certainly as low as 40,000 volts, and similar
               results have been obtained for other $\beta$-ray bodies. If this
               result is interpreted as showing that different disintegrating
               nuclei of the same substance emit their disintegration electron
               with different energies, we must deduce that in this case the
               energy of disintegration is not a characteristic constant of the
               body, but can vary between wide limits. Many workers have
               considered this to be so contrary both to the ideas of the
               quantum theory and the definiteness shown by radioactive
               disintegration that they have asserted the inhomogeneity must be
               a result of some secondary process, such as collision with the
               extranuclear electrons or emission of general
               $\gamma$-radiation, and that although we cannot observe them
               before they become inhomogeneous, the disintegration electrons
               are actually emitted from the nucleus with a definite
               characteristic energy as in the case of the $\alpha$-particles.",

               500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values,
               mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the
               radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density
               in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a
               special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an
               additional 1.75 $\times$ 106 travel time observations for P and
               S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the
               entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic
               dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the
               outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the
               shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This
               anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The
               horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by
               2--4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not

               surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper
               mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced
               low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models

               from the fusion of two protons (the pp chain). The neutrinos
               emitted by five of these reactions represent a unique probe of
               the Sun's internal working and, at the same time, offer an
               intense natural neutrino beam for fundamental physics. Here we
               report a complete study of the pp chain. We measure the
               neutrino-electron elastic-scattering rates for neutrinos
               produced by four reactions of the chain: the initial
               proton-proton fusion, the electron-capture decay of beryllium-7,
               the three-body proton-electron-proton (pep) fusion, here
               measured with the highest precision so far achieved, and the
               boron-8 beta decay, measured with the lowest energy threshold.
               We also set a limit on the neutrino flux produced by the
               3He-proton fusion (hep). These measurements provide a direct
               determination of the relative intensity of the two primary

               solar models that assume high surface metallicity. We also

               multi-purpose underground liquid scintillator detector, was
               proposed with the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy
               (MH) as a primary physics goal. The excellent energy resolution
               and the large fiducial volume anticipated for the JUNO detector
               offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important
               topics in neutrino and astro-particle physics. In this document,
               we present the physics motivations and the anticipated
               performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed
               measurements. Following an introduction summarizing the current
               status and open issues in neutrino physics, we discuss how the
               detection of antineutrinos generated by a cluster of nuclear
               power plants allows the determination of the neutrino MH at a
               3--4$\sigma$ significance with six years of running of JUNO. The
               measurement of antineutrino spectrum with excellent energy
               resolution will also lead to the precise determination of the
               neutrino oscillation parameters , , and to an accuracy of better
               than 1\%, which will play a crucial role in the future unitarity
               test of the MNSP matrix. The JUNO detector is capable of
               observing not only antineutrinos from the power plants, but also
               neutrinos/antineutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial
               sources, including supernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova
               neutrino background, geoneutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, and
               solar neutrinos. As a result of JUNO's large size, excellent
               energy resolution, and vertex reconstruction capability,
               interesting new data on these topics can be collected. For
               example, a neutrino burst from a typical core-collapse supernova
               at a distance of 10 kpc would lead to ~5000 inverse-beta-decay
               events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino--proton ES events in JUNO,
               which are of crucial importance for understanding the mechanism
               of supernova explosion and for exploring novel phenomena such as
               collective neutrino oscillations. Detection of neutrinos from
               all past core-collapse supernova explosions in the visible
               universe with JUNO would further provide valuable information on
               the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapse
               neutrino energy spectrum. Antineutrinos originating from the
               radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth can be
               detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400 events per year,
               significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino
               event samples. Atmospheric neutrino events collected in JUNO can
               provide independent inputs for determining the MH and the octant
               of the mixing angle. Detection of the 7Be and 8B solar neutrino
               events at JUNO would shed new light on the solar metallicity
               problem and examine the transition region between the vacuum and
               matter dominated neutrino oscillations. Regarding light sterile
               neutrino topics, sterile neutrinos with and a sufficiently large
               mixing angle could be identified through a precise measurement
               of the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum. Meanwhile, JUNO can
               also provide us excellent opportunities to test the eV-scale
               sterile neutrino hypothesis, using either the radioactive
               neutrino sources or a cyclotron-produced neutrino beam. The JUNO
               detector is also sensitive to several other
               beyondthe-standard-model physics. Examples include the search
               for proton decay via the decay channel, search for neutrinos
               resulting from dark-matter annihilation in the Sun, search for
               violation of Lorentz invariance via the sidereal modulation of
               the reactor neutrino event rate, and search for the effects of
               non-standard interactions. The proposed construction of the JUNO
               detector will provide a unique facility to address many
               outstanding crucial questions in particle and astrophysics in a
               timely and cost-effective fashion. It holds the great potential
               for further advancing our quest to understanding the fundamental
               properties of neutrinos, one of the building blocks of our
               Universe.",

  author    = "{T2K Collaboration}",
  abstract  = "The charge-conjugation and parity-reversal (CP) symmetry of
               fundamental particles is a symmetry between matter and
               antimatter. Violation of this CP symmetry was first observed in
               19641, and CP violation in the weak interactions of quarks was
               soon established2. Sakharov proposed3 that CP violation is
               necessary to explain the observed imbalance of matter and
               antimatter abundance in the Universe. However, CP violation in
               quarks is too small to support this explanation. So far, CP
               violation has not been observed in non-quark elementary particle
               systems. It has been shown that CP violation in leptons could
               generate the matter-antimatter disparity through a process
               called leptogenesis4. Leptonic mixing, which appears in the
               standard model's charged current interactions5,6, provides a
               potential source of CP violation through a complex phase
               $\delta$CP, which is required by some theoretical models of
               leptogenesis7-9. This CP violation can be measured in muon
               neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the corresponding
               antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible
               using accelerator-produced beams as established by the
               Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) and NOvA experiments10,11. Until now, the
               value of $\delta$CP has not been substantially constrained by
               neutrino oscillation experiments. Here we report a measurement
               using long-baseline neutrino and antineutrino oscillations
               observed by the T2K experiment that shows a large increase in
               the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding values of
               $\delta$CP that result in a large increase in the observed
               antineutrino oscillation probability at three standard
               deviations (3$\sigma$). The 3$\sigma$ confidence interval for
               $\delta$CP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2$\pi$, is [-3.41,
               -0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering and [-2.54, -0.32]
               for the inverted mass ordering. Our results indicate CP
               violation in leptons and our method enables sensitive searches
               for matter-antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using
               accelerator-produced neutrino beams. Future measurements with
               larger datasets will test whether leptonic CP violation is
               larger than the CP violation in quarks.",

               million metric tons, approximately 20 (25) times larger than
               that of Super-Kamiokande. One of the main goals of
               Hyper-Kamiokande is the study of $CP$ asymmetry in the lepton
               sector using accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino beams. In
               this paper, the physics potential of a long baseline neutrino
               experiment using the Hyper-Kamiokande detector and a neutrino
               beam from the J-PARC proton synchrotron is presented. The
               analysis uses the framework and systematic uncertainties derived
               from the ongoing T2K experiment. With a total exposure of 7.5 MW
               $\times$ 10$^7$ sec integrated proton beam power (corresponding
               to $1.56\times10^\{22\}$ protons on target with a 30 GeV proton

               to better than 19 degrees for all possible values of
               $\delta_\{CP\}$, and $CP$ violation can be established with a
               statistical significance of more than $3\,\sigma$ ($5\,\sigma$)
               for $76\%$ ($58\%$) of the $\delta_\{CP\}$ parameter space.

               base line neutrino oscillation experiment that probes physics
               beyond the Standard Model by high precision measurements of the
               neutrino masses and mixing. A high intensity narrow band
               neutrino beam is produced by secondary pions created by a high
               intensity proton synchrotron at JHF (JAERI). The neutrino energy
               is tuned to the oscillation maximum at ~1 GeV for a baseline
               length of 295 km towards the world largest water Cerenkov
               detector, Super-Kamiokande. Its excellent energy resolution and
               particle identification enable the reconstruction of the initial
               neutrino energy, which is compared with the narrow band neutrino
               energy, through the quasi-elastic interaction. The physics goal
               of the first phase is an order of magnitude better precision in
               the nu\_mu to nu\_tau oscillation measurement (delta(Delta
               m\_23^2)=10^-4 eV^2 and delta(sin^22theta\_23)=0.01), a factor
               of 20 more sensitive search in the nu\_mu to nu\_e appearance
               (sin^22theta\_\{mu e\} ~ 0.5sin^22theta\_\{13\}>0.003), and a
               confirmation of the nu\_mu to nu\_tau oscillation or discovery
               of sterile neutrinos by detecting the neutral current events. In
               the second phase, an upgrade of the accelerator from 0.75 MW to
               4 MW in beam power and the construction of 1 Mt Hyper-Kamiokande
               detector at Kamioka site are envisaged. Another order of
               magnitude improvement in the nu\_mu to nu\_e oscillation
               sensitivity, a sensitive search of the CP violation in the
               lepton sector (CP phase ``delta'' down to 10-20 degrees), and an
               order of magnitude improvement in the proton decay sensitivity

               measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered
               Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize
               searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric
               particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle
               properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We
               give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics
               such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified
               Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology,

               including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction
               and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons. The

               for cosmological parameter estimation. Chains are generated to
               sample the posterior probability distribution obtained following
               the Bayesian approach. An important issue is how to optimize the
               efficiency of such sampling and how to diagnose whether a
               finite-length chain has adequately sampled the underlying
               posterior probability distribution. We show how the power
               spectrum of a single such finite chain may be used as a
               convergence diagnostic by means of a fitting function, and
               discuss strategies for optimizing the distribution for the
               proposed steps. The methods developed are applied to current
               cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data

               mixed adiabatic/isocurvature cosmological model including
               possible correlations between modes. For the latter application,
               because of the increased dimensionality and the presence of
               degeneracies, the need for tuning MCMC methods for maximum

               neutrino oscillation experiment at the BNL AGS. It has been

               experiment will search for oscillations in the \{nu\}\{sub

               \{leftrightarrow\} \{nu\}\{sub e\} appearance channel by means
               of four identical neutrino detectors located 1, 3, 24, and 68km
               from the AGS neutrino source. Observed depletion of the

               directed toward exploration of the region of the neutrino
               oscillation parameters \{Delta\}m\{sup 2\} and sin\{sup
               2\}2\{theta\}, suggested by the Kamiokande and IMB deep

               than two orders of magnitude larger than that of previous
               accelerator experiments. The experiment will run in a mode new
               to BNL. It will receive the fast extracted proton beam on the
               neutrino target approximately 20 hours per day when the AGS is
               not filling RHIC. A key aspect of the experimental design
               involves placing the detectors 1.5 degrees off the center line
               of the neutrino beam, which has the important advantage that the
               central value of the neutrino energy (\{approx\} 1 GeV) and the
               beam spectral shape are, to a good approximation, the same in

               water Cherenkov detectors similar in large part to the
               Kamiokande and IMB detectors. The design has profited from their

The independency of reweighting individual events in a Monte Carlo sample lends itself to parallel implementation on a graphics processing unit. The library Prob3++ was ported to the GPU using the CUDA C API, allowing for large scale parallelized calculations of neutrino oscillation probabilities through matter of constant density, decreasing the execution time by 2 orders of magnitude when compared to performance on a single CPU.},

@article{cudaprob3,
	Abstract = {The computation of neutrino flavor transition amplitudes through inhomogeneous matter is a time-consuming step and thus could benefit from optimization and parallelization. Next to reliable parameter estimation of intrinsic physical quantities such as neutrino masses and mixing angles, these transition amplitudes are important in hypothesis testing of potential extensions of the standard model of elementary particle physics, such as additional neutrino flavors. Hence, fast yet precise implementations are of high importance to research. In the recent past, massively parallel accelerators such as CUDA-enabled GPUs featuring thousands of compute units have been widely adopted due to their superior memory bandwidth, vast compute capability, and highly competitive compute-to-energy ratio in comparison to traditional multi-core architectures with a few tens of monolithic cores. In this paper, we introduce two scalable multi-GPU extensions of common neutrino oscillation frameworks -- namely Prob3++ and νSQuIDS --allowing for the acceleration of oscillation dynamics computation by one to three orders-of-magnitude while preserving numerical accuracy. Our software is licensed under LGPLv3 and can be accessed at https://github.com/fkallen/CUDAProb3 and https://github.com/fkallen/CUDAnuSQuIDS.

SK searches for distortions of the solar neutrino energy spectrum caused by the edge of the MSW resonance in the core of the Sun. The installation of new front-end electronics in 2008 marks the beginning of the 4th phase of SK (SK-IV). With the improvement of the water circulation system, calibration methods, reduction cuts, this phase achieved the lowest energy threshold thus far (3.5 MeV kinetic energy). To improve the sensitivity to the MSW effect, it is required to achieve lower energy threshold. For this purpose, understanding the origin of background events and reducing them are important. Currently, the main background is known as a beta decay of 214Bi in a Radon decay chain. So far, SK collaboration has developed several techniques for studying Radon contamination in the SK water. In this proceedings, a measurement system which can measure Radon concentration in the SK water with the accuracy of 0.1 mBq/m3 level is presented. In addition, an evaluation of Radon background events in SK injecting Radon rich water into the SK tank, as well as future prospects are also presented.}

               and the K2K long-baseline neutrino beam with high efficiency.
