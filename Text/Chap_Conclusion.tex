\chapter{Conclusions and Outlook}

This thesis has presented the sensitivites of the first offcial joint beam and atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameter measurements from the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) and Super-Kamiokande (SK) collaborations. It combines the two independent analyses presented by the two independent collaborations \finish{citations}. This equates to a combined \quickmath{3244.4} days equivalent of SK-IV livetime and \quickmath{1.97 \times 10^{21}}(\quickmath{1.63 \times 10^{21}}) POT in the neutrino and antineutrino beam operating modes, respectively.
